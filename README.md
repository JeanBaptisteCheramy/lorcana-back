# About me
Welcome to my Github.

https://github.com/JeanBaptisteCheramy

This is a project I am working on to explore AdonisJS. I am self-learning by conducting research on the internet. I work using the documentation and all possible resources to enhance my skills on a daily basis.

If you are a recruiter, feel free to contact me via LinkedIn. I am always optimistic about engaging in discussions and open to new opportunities.

# Lorcana-back

This is a backend project for the trading card game Lorcana, built in Node.js using the AdonisJS framework (TypeScript). The idea is for users to create their own collection and build decks with it.

It's a work in progress.
